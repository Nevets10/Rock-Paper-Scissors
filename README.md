# Rock-Paper-Scissors

First JavaScript project for The Odin Project

Prompt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#assignment

Post project reflection:
This took a little longer than expected since I went back and forth on a few choices and I added a few things that weren't explicitly mentioned in the prompt. However, I think it turned out pretty good.

Prompt 2: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors

Post project reflection 2 - Post UI branch:
This was probably way too overkill for the actual assignment, but I wanted to make something that I would actually enjoy looking at.

I also wanted to have the computer cycling through their choices as it waits for the player, but I ditched that idea to get this done in a timely manner. Maybe I'll add it later...
