# Rock-Paper-Scissors

First JavaScript project for The Odin Project

Prompt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors#assignment

Post project reflection:
This took a little longer than expected since I went back and forth on a few choices and I added a few things that weren't explicitly mentioned in the prompt. However, I think it turned out pretty good.
